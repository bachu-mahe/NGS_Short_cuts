ls -R | grep ":$" | sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'

#This one-liner initially does a recursive listing of the current directory: ls -R.
#Any output other that the directory names, identified by ":" at the very end of each line (hence ":$"), is filtered out: grep ":$".
#Finally there's a little of "sed" magic replacing any hierarchy level ("/") with dashes ("-"): sed ....
#Works for me with Bash under Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris.
